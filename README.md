# Helix Programming Language 🚀

[Work In Progress] Welcome to the exciting world of Helix, a versatile and ambitious general-purpose programming language that's here to empower your coding journey. Helix is on a mission to provide you with essential features like mathematical operations, integer variable declarations, and single-line comments, setting the stage for a bright future filled with if/else statements, functions, loops, and modules. With an open-source MIT license, we invite you to be part of this thrilling ride. 🌟

## Features 🌈

Helix begins its journey with these core capabilities:

- ➕➖✖️➗ Mathematical Operations: Helix is your mathematical wizard, ready to tackle basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—with precision and elegance.

- 🔢 Integer Variable Declarations: Declare integer variables effortlessly to manage and manipulate numeric data efficiently.

- 📝 Single-lined Comments: Enhance code readability and organization with single-line comments, which Helix gracefully ignores during compilation.

## The Grand Vision 🌠

Helix is more than just a language; it's a grand vision:

- 🧩 **Turing Completeness**: Helix is embarking on a thrilling journey to achieve Turing completeness. Upcoming features include if/else statements, functions, loops, and modules, transforming Helix into a versatile tool for a wide range of programming tasks.

- 🌐 **Type System**: The future of Helix includes a robust type system that will add a layer of safety and expressiveness to your code.

- 🎨 **VSCode Syntax Highlighting**: Imagine the joy of writing Helix code with syntax highlighting in Visual Studio Code. We're actively working to make this a reality, enhancing your coding experience.

- ⚙️ **Language Server Protocol (LSP)**: Helix aspires to provide an ambitious Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation, elevating it to a premier language in the development ecosystem.

## Supported Platforms 🖥️

Helix is currently tailored for the x86_64 architecture and supports the following operating systems:

- Linux 🐧
- macOS 🍏

## Under the Hood 🧰

Helix utilizes NASM as the assembler, ensuring efficient and robust code generation for the x86_64 architecture.

## Hello, Variables! 💡

To declare a variable in Helix, use the following syntax:

```javascript
let four = 2 + 2;
```

Note that all lines in Helix should end with a semicolon.
